Uncommented disassembly of the VIC 20 game 'Dig Dug', in KickAssembler format.

Requires 8K of RAM in Banks 1 ($2000) and 5 ($A000). VICE must also be set to 'Inject To RAM'. 

Upon running the code, the emulator will show a black screen. Perform a 'soft reset' with Alt-F9 and the game should launch.
